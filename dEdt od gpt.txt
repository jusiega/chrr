Alright, let’s do it step by step with a **1D Hamiltonian system**, where it’s easiest to see how (dE) and (dt) give a phase-space volume element.

## 1. Set up a 1D Hamiltonian

Suppose we have a standard Hamiltonian:
[
H(x,p) = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
]

A trajectory with energy (E) satisfies:
[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \implies p(x) = \pm \sqrt{2m(E - V(x))}
]

---

## 2. Infinitesimal phase-space volume

The phase-space element is (dV = dx,dp). Along a trajectory, (dp) and (dx) are related through the energy:

[
dp = \frac{d}{dx} \left(\sqrt{2m(E - V(x))}\right) dx
]

But if we’re given a **small energy shell** (dE), we can instead write the area in the **(x,p) plane) that corresponds to that shell:

[
dV = \int_{x_\text{min}}^{x_\text{max}} dx , \frac{dp}{dE} , dE
]

Where (\frac{dp}{dE}) comes from differentiating (p(E) = \sqrt{2m(E - V(x))}):

[
\frac{dp}{dE} = \frac{m}{p(x)}
]

So locally:
[
dV = dx , \frac{m}{p(x)} , dE
]

## 3. Connect (dx) to (dt)

Along a trajectory:
[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \frac{p}{m} \implies dx = \frac{p}{m} dt
]

Plug that in:

[
dV = \underbrace{\frac{p}{m} dt}_{dx} \cdot \frac{m}{p} dE = dt , dE
]

Boom! ✅

This is exactly the simple “phase-space volume = energy interval × time interval” formula you sometimes see.

* **Intuition:** Over a small time (dt), a trajectory at energy (E) sweeps out a little rectangle in phase space whose “height” is determined by (dE).
* **1D simplicity:** The (p/m) and (m/p) factors cancel.

## 4. Summary formula

For 1D Hamiltonian systems:

[
\boxed{dV = dE , dt}
]

* (dE) = small energy shell
* (dt) = small time along the trajectory
* (dV) = infinitesimal phase-space volume represented by the trajectory segment

**This is exactly how you can assign a “ΔVᵢ” along characteristics if you want to be rigorous.**

* In higher dimensions, you’d include the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation from ((x_1,\dots,p_n)) to ((E_1, ..., t_1, ...)).
* In 1D, the cancellation is beautiful and makes life easy.

If you want, I can sketch a **tiny numerical example** showing three points moving along characteristics with assigned (dE) and (dt), and how their ΔVᵢ stays constant while computing weighted averages. It’s extremely concrete. Do you want me to do that?
